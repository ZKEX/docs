# ðŸ”’ Security

## Asset security

With zero-knowledge proofs, security is guaranteed at a high level, so the danger of malicious behavior by anyone (not even the ZKEX team) is virtually eliminated.

Transactions are mathematically verified, ensuring every trade completes as expected, or in a worse-case scenario it simply rolls back.

## What is Zero Knowledge?

Zero Knowledge is a branch of cryptography that uses mathematics to calculate something called a â€˜ZK-Proofâ€™ â€¦ which is basically acts like a seal of approval that can be checked if something is guaranteed to be true.

This ZK-Proof is a one-way calculation of the transaction, which cannot be reverse engineered to reveal the details of that transaction.

In the case of a coin swap between two people, there are two coins going each way, so we actually have two ZK-Proofs. By further calculating these two ZK-Proofs together, we create something called a â€˜ZK-recursive-proofâ€™.

In the end, we have one single calculation to verify the result of the entire two-way transaction. This single â€˜ZK-recursive-proofâ€™ verified the transactions happened and completed successfully â€” and can be published on the blockchain without revealing any details of the people involved.

## Security audits

Security audits will be conducted before each major update.

## Bug Bounty Program

We will offer a bug bounty program, with generous rewards.

## Decentralization

During the development phase, ZKEX is operating as non-custodial, centrally operated entity. As the project progresses, we will further decentralise all parts of our infrastructure and organization.
