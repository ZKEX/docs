## Credit Cookie: Token Merge

> One of ZKEX's unique features is that we eliminate the difference of the same kind of tokens on different chains (e.g., USDT-Solana and USDT-Ethereum) and merge them into **the same kind** on ZKEX layer2 order book DEX.

To experience this magical trick, you should:

1. Claim test tokens (USDC) from different chains to your Metamask on [L1 faucet](https://zk.link/app/faucet).

- a. Select a network.
- b. Choose a token.
- c. Click "Get".
- d. Switch a network and repeat step a to c.
  $$$$$$(8)

2. Deposit them separately from each chain to ZKEX.

- a. Connect your wallet.
- b. Click "Deposit".
- c. Choose network, token, amount, and click "Approve".
- d. Switch a network and repeat step a to c.

  $$$$$$(10)

3. You will see that there's no difference of USDC by chains on ZKEX, and the balance from each chain is summed up, displayed as "USDC".
