# ðŸ“„ Get started on the ZKEX Testnet

## Add the testnet networks to your wallet

The ZKEX testnet is a demo playground and uses several testnet network chains to allow people to conduct test multi-chain trades with 'fake' tokens.

Goerli Testnet and Rinkeby Testnet (Ethereum Testnets) are setup by in Metamask.

Go to https://chainlist.org/ and check 'Testnets'. You need to connect your wallet to the site so that the networks are added automatically.
